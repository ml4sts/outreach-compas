Risk scoring algorithms are widely used by judges to inform their scentencing and bail decisions in the criminal justice system in the United States.

    "A discussion of using calibration to verify the fairness of a model can be found in Northpoint's (now: Equivant) response to the ProPublica article [6](#References).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind calibrating a classifier is that you want the confidence of the predictor to reflect the true outcomes. So, in a well-calibrated classifier, if 100 people are assigned 90% confidence of being in the positive class, then in reality, 90 of them should actually have had a positive label.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use calibration as a fairness metric we compare the calibration of the classifier for each group.  The smaller the difference, the more fair the calssifier.\n",
